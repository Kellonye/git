Question 4:
Write a function that takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of all that numberâ€™s digits.
For example: function_name(1234) should return 10 which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4. (Assume that the number you are given will always be positive.)


Ans 4:

first consideration:

I could write a simple addition function like this below;

function kSum(a,b,c) {
	return a + b + c
	}

console.log(kSum(a,b,c);

// such that kSum value of (15,12,13) will return 40 as its value.


second consideration:


or a more complex one like this below;


const sumN = (n) => {
// the number'n' will be entered as a string value and converted into an array of numbers below:

var myNumList = n.split("").map(Number);

     
    // need to create a variable to store the sum
    	var sum = 0;
     
    // Running the for loop
    	for (let i = 0; i < myNumList.length; i++) {
        sum += myNumList[i];
    }
        console.log(myNumList);
    	console.log(sum);
}
// a number string of '12345' will out put an array of numbers[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and '15' as the sum of numbers in the array.
